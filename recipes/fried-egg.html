    <h2>Sometimes I make a fried egg in the morning, but also sometimes I don't... really depends, I guess?
        It is easier to just make cereal. I like miniwheats but I get made fun of because my roommate considers 
        it to be "old man" cereal even though I'm 25, and really that doesn't seem very old to me. But that depends on perspective, doesn't it? I bet My 4 year old Niece probably considers me to an old wretched thing. At least I know what 12 + 3 is. Get ratioed kid</h2>
